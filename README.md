# Record Labels and Bands Database Application

### Project Description
#### What is the application?
We are developing a database application to manage information about record labels and bands that are signed to them. The database keeps track of all
the revenue streams of a band (eg. songs, concerts, merchandise, etc.).

#### Who can use this application?
This application is intended to be used by people who work in the record label industry and the bands signed to them. Record labels are companies 
that market recorded music for bands. The application allows record labels to organize logistic information about the different revenue streams of
bands that are signed to them. Bands can also use the application to keep track of their music, concerts, merchandise, and other necessary information.

For a more detailed project description and specific functionalities this application provides, see file "Milestone 1".

#### What is our tech stack?
Our tech stack is PHP/Oracle. We are planning to use CSS+HTML for the front-end and Python for the back-end.


For an ongoing timeline of the project and our expected challenges, see file "Timeline and Challenges".
